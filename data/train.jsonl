{"text":"<s>[INST] what features should I look for in a reliable car [/INST]When looking for a reliable car, there are several features that you should consider:\n\n1. Reliability history: Check the car's reliability record by researching its make and model, as well as reading owner reviews and reports from organizations like Consumer Reports or J.D. Power.\n2. Maintenance requirements: Consider a car with low maintenance requirements, such as a simple engine design and few moving parts. Regularly scheduled maintenance is important for keeping a car reliable, so be sure to factor in the cost and time required for routine upkeep.\n3. Safety features: A reliable car should have a good safety rating from organizations like the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS). Look for cars with advanced safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind spot monitoring.\n4. Durable construction: A car's build quality can impact its reliability. Look for a car with a solid frame, rust-resistant body panels, and high-quality materials in key areas like the engine, transmission, and suspension.\n5. Engine and transmission: A reliable car should have a strong and durable engine and transmission. Look for cars with a proven track record of reliability in these areas, as well as good fuel economy and power output.\n6. Comfort and convenience features: While not directly related to reliability, comfort and convenience features can make your driving experience more enjoyable and reduce the likelihood of breakdowns or maintenance issues. Consider features like climate control, comfortable seating, easy-to-use infotainment system, and ample cargo space.\n7. Warranty coverage: A good warranty can provide peace of mind and help cover the cost of repairs if something goes wrong. Look for a car with a comprehensive warranty that covers both powertrain and non-powertrain components for an extended period of time.</s>"}
