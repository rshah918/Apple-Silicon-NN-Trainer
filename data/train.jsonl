Reliability history: Check the car's reliability record by researching its make and model, as well as reading owner reviews and reports from organizations like Consumer Reports or J.D. Power.\n2. Maintenance requirements: Consider a car with low maintenance requirements, such as a simple engine design and few moving parts.

Look for cars with advanced safety features, such as automatic emergency braking, lane departure warning, and blind spot monitoring.\n4. Durable construction: A car's build quality can impact its reliability.
